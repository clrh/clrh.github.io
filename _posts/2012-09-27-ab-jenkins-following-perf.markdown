title: Continuous integration, Jenkins, Apache benchark and following performance evolutions

My goal was to follow a website request time during a developpment process. I use jenkins only to cron my script but the conrtab is well enought.

Choices like language and algorythm are surely enhanceable but as it, it can be usefull for someone.

Fist, ab (Apache Benchmark) provide ability to request a website page
